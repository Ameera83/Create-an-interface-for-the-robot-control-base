In this task, an interface was created for the robot control base, in which we used the codes (HTML - CSS - JavaScript) and this interface was provided with five buttons for directions (forward - back - stop - right - left).
Then we created a database named (orientation) and we created a table called (directional buttons) and entered the names of the buttons, then we created the PHP code to link the database with the interface, we also took screenshots of both the interface and the databases
